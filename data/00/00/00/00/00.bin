----[Release Notes]-------------------------------------> 
   
A story of love, giraffes, and hot dogs.

Inspired by classic platformers and cartoons alike,
The Adventure Pals sets you and your best friends 
(a giraffe and a rock) out to save the world and your
dad from turning into hotdogs! Level up to learn special
abilities, throw bombs and whack things with your sword.

Find cupcakes to unlock costumes and fill your scrap
book up with secret stickers across five big, creative
areas each with unique levels. Explore the mystical
forests of Treevale, hike the haunted craters of the
moon and dive into the depths of the ocean to find the
lost city of Crablantis.

It's a mixture of lovingly handcrafted action-
platforming levels, and RPG-like locations with
townsfolk who provide quests, items and other goodies
for you to buy to aid you on your journey. Just like
your favorite peanut butter and jelly sandwich, The 
Adventure pals is both nutty and sweet,with perhaps
just a little crunch. It's lighthearted, goofy fun no
matter what your age.

Oh, and three words: Giraffe. Helicopter. Tongue.
